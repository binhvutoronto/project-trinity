# SYMPSEARCH 

My colleagues and I were tasked with creating a project to demonstrate the skills that we have acquired up to date at our coding bootcamp.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our team's knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and the use of APIs. In determining the theme of our project, we wanted to create an application that had potentia for a real world use-case. As two members of our team are in the healthcare industry, we decided to create an application that provides the user with access to information of healthcare service providers.

The end result is SympSearch - a search engine that allows users to search for doctors according to the symptoms that they are experiencing. The application utilizes the BetterDoctor API to identify doctors based in the U.S.; and utilizes the Google Maps API to map out the location of the doctors in the search results.

How to:

User input's their condition in the search bar User clicks on search button to the right side. The user is directed to the second page where a list of specialist's is populated. In the lists page, the user will have access to the specialist's information ie. geographical location, phone numbers, profile information and profile picture.

This project will be updated accordingly.

Current bugs:

There is currently a bug in the search field as some conditions may not trigger a search response.
